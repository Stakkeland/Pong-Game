# Overview

This is a basic pong game with user customization.

This game keeps track of the score and lets you play until you quit. It is a 2 player game with customizable name and paddle color. Press W and S for Player 1 and the up and down key for Player 2 to move the paddle.

I wanted a small project to learn how to use python turtle and pygame.
